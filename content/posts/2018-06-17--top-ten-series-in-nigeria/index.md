#### 10- Lekki Wives
On this backdrop, I believe Blessing Egbeâ€™s new flick, Lekki Wives, is a splendid and blunt portrayal of the wealth madness at all cost syndrome which has become endemic and contagious in us as a nation. In the film or drama series as one might choose to classify it, we see married ladies all out to do anything to move into the Lekki highbrow, maintain the suave and nouveau riche lifestyle, mingle and associate with the timbers and calibers of the society at the detriment of their family.

#### 6- MTV Shuga
The underlying theme of this show is enlightenment on the HIV/AIDS menace in Africa in the bid to disseminate knowledge. The first season was commissioned by MTV Africa and the Partnership for an HIV-Free Generation and the Government of Kenya amongst others. Lupita Nyongo was part of the first and second season after which Shuga moved from Nairobi to Lagos. Tiwa Savage, Ikechukwu and other celebrities have also featured in Shuga, making it  an amazing platform to educate young people on safe sex, family planning amongst others. With 3 seasons done and dusted, the 4th season is going to be amazing.
