#### 7- Olumo Rock
Olumo Rock is a popular tourist attraction in the city of Abeokuta, Nigeria. It was used as a fortress by the Egba people in the early 19th century.Olumo rock, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Nigeria, West Africa, sits in the ancient city center of Abeokuta – a name which means “Under the rock”.
      New renovations completed early 2006 upgraded the infrastructure of the site to include a new museum, restaurants, water fountain and The ancient Itoku market where local artisans and traders enjoy to haggle over price just as much as the customers like to find a bargain just outside the Olumo rock premises and is a must-see. The market is the center of the indigenous Abeokuta industry of tie-and-dye, locally known as adire. In places where the plaster has cracked off the walls, you may see traces of the mud bricks used in the original construction. The locals are very friendly and if asked, will often give tourists and visitors informal tours of the dyeing processes. Other popular items to watch out for include local beads, bracelets, sculptures and musical instruments like the sekere and talking drum.
     A trip to Olumo rock usually commences with a climb up the man-made stairs carved into the rock. The journey continues with climbs on irregularly sized rocks (or ladders which are now provided) through a narrow corridor that leads to the top of the rock. All along the way, catch sights of carvings in the rock, cowrie-studded statues and the ancient abode of the priestesses who live in huts on the rock.
On the way back down the rock, the sight of the Ogun river running like a silver chain amidst a forest of aged red corrugated roofs bordered by thick green forests which melt into the horizon is breathtaking.

#### 2- Obudu Mountain Resort
Obudu Mountain Resort (formerly known as the Obudu Cattle Ranch) is a ranch and resort on the Obudu Plateau in Cross River State, Nigeria. It was developed in 1951 by Mr. McCaughley, a Scot who first explored the mountain ranges in 1949. He camped on the mountaintop of the Oshie Ridge on the Sankwala Mountains for a month before returning with Mr. Hugh Jones a fellow rancher who, in 1951, together with Dr Crawfeild developed the Obudu Cattle Ranch. Although the ranch has been through troubles since, it has very recently been rehabilitated to its former glory. A recently added cable car from the base to the top of the plateau gives visitors a scenic view while bypassing the extremely winding road to the top.
       The ranch has in recent times seen an influx of both Nigerian and international tourists because of the development of tourist facilities by Cross-River State Government which has turned the ranch into one of the well known holiday and tourist resort centers in Nigeria.
