#### 8- Pastor E.A Adebayo
Enoch Adejare Adeboye is a Nigerian pastor.
Leader of the largest Pentecostal church in Nigeria (Redeemed Christian Church of God) and former mathematics lecturer, Adeboye is on this list because as innocuous as he might appear, the soft-spoken preacher has under his influence millions of Nigerians who either attend his church or depend on his position on important matters as guides to make crucial decisions. Available statistics show that Pastor Adeboye has about 12 million members in the around 14, 000 RCCG branches scattered across the length and breadth of Nigeria. Further statistics gathered from Newsweek magazine shows that about 5million of these population are adults who are well over voting age, not youths. This implies that Adeboye has a hold over 8.4% of about 60 million Nigerians who are registered to vote and vote. In 2007, when the total voter population was around 72million, Adeboye, all things being equal, had influence over about 7.1% of the votes cast. He has always been relevant. 

If you have any doubts about Adeboye’s right to be on this list and at this spot, please be reminded that he is the senior pastor to vice president, Yemi Osinbajo and that he sanctioned the law professor’s decision to race with Buhari. What if he had said ‘no’?
