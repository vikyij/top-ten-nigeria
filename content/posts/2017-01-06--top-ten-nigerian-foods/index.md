Abacha is also known as ‘African Salad’ and it can be eaten as a meal or snack. Many people eat it as a meal because it is fills up your stomach just like any other meal.African Salad is usually eaten as an in-between meal. This meal is well-known in the Eastern part of Nigeria, among the Igbo tribes and they love it.
     Abacha is prepared with cassava. The cassava tubers are cooked till done then sliced with a special grater. The sliced cassava is then soaked in cold water overnight, washed thoroughly and dried under the sun.
     Your African Salad will not be complete without Ugba. Ugba, also known as Ukpaka, is made from oil bean seeds. These seeds are cooked for several hours then sliced, washed and left to ferment a little bit.
